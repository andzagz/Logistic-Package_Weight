# Logistic-Package_Weight
# Logistical Load Maximization Project: Packing Analysis

## Introduction

This project aims to enhance logistical capabilities through the maximization of package load, considering constraints related to fragility and vehicle weight.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a Python script utilizing the `pandas` and `numpy` libraries to perform the following stages:

1. **Data Generation**: Random generation of package data.
2. **Linear Programming**: Using the PULP library, weight and fragility constraints were defined, as well as the allocation of each package to one of the vehicles.
   The problem was structured within a Machine Learning framework, solved through maximization.
3. **Load**: Exporting the processed data.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.

## Features

- The data is generated by the code itself; feel free to substitute it.
- Processes and cleans the collected data.
